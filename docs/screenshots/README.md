## Contributing Screenshots

- Place images in this `docs/screenshots/` directory.
- Prefer PNG or high-quality JPEG.
- Recommended resolution: 1280×720 for consistent presentation.
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `dashboard-overview.png`, `chat-personality-switch.png`).
- Always include meaningful alt text in Markdown for accessibility.
- Organize new images under the most relevant section above or add a new section if needed.

### How to add

1. Save your image into `docs/screenshots/` using a descriptive filename.
2. Edit this README and add an entry under the appropriate section:
   
   `![Concise alt text](./your-image-name.png)`

3. Preview locally with your editor’s Markdown preview.
4. Commit and push:
   
   `git add docs/screenshots/README.md docs/screenshots/your-image-name.png`
   
   `git commit -m "docs(screenshots): add <short description>"`
   
   `git push`
5. Open the repository on GitHub and confirm images render as expected.

## Standards

- Consistent sizing: capture at 1280×720 where possible.
- Visual quality: avoid blurry or overly compressed images.
- Accessibility: alt text must describe what the screenshot shows.
- Paths: use relative paths from this README, e.g. `./image-name.png`.
